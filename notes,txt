Overall goal:
app that takes some instruction and produces lorem ipsum for the user.
User can specify how many paragraphs of Laura Ipsum they would like to have generated.
user input - select the number of words they would like
app output - pargarphs of Laura ipsum displayed to user meeting their requirement

JS concepts:
field where user enters number of paragraphs they want generated.
example '5' is the input.
JS will need and empty variable at first that is then populated by the 5.

<!-- Receiving the input -->
let intake = document.getelementbyID.(TEXTBOXID).value

this box will be an empty field that can accept integers, and the submit send the intake somewhere.
will need basic form validation 
<form>
<input type="text" name="number">
<input type=(submit) value="submit">
</form>

<!-- utilizing the intake value to tell us how many pagraphs to generate and instert into the dom -->
